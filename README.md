# Note

This project is a "work in progress"; while it is usable/playable, I have high personal quality standards and don't yet consider this project "ready for public consumption" at this moment in time. Tread at your own risk.

For more information, [please visit the documentation](http://sewer56.dev/Riders.Tweakbox/), it's cool.

## 🌍 Netplay / Online Multiplayer

<img src="./docs/Images/SingleScreen.png" />

At the current moment in time, Netplay works in the following manner:
- Host enters Free Race/Grand Prix/Tag/Battle Mode.
- Host presses `Host` in Track Select Mode, waits for everyone to connect.
- Client enters same mode as host (Free Race/Grand Prix/Tag/Battle Mode).
- Client connects to the host by entering their IP & Port combination. 
- Host and Client select stage & characters together.
- After race finishes, Host and Client manually go back to stage select.

If you don't know the host's IP, ask the host to use a website such as [WhatIsMyIp](https://whatismyip.host).
You're interested in IPv4.
