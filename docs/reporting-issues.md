# Reporting Issues

I am currently interested in:  
- Netplay Crashes  
- Misc. Bugs

## What to Include (Crash Reports)

When submitting a crash report, you should include the following:

---------

- **Reloaded Console Log**

You can find the log if you navigate to `%appdata%/Reloaded-Mod-Loader-II/Logs` inside explorer.

Sort by "Date Modified" and grab the latest log.

Press the Windows key and search for "Event Viewer".

Navigate to `Windows Logs -> Application`, find an `Error` event with Source `.NET Runtime`.

Right click and press `Save Selected Events`.

If you are recording your gameplay, the moment of the crash would also be greatly appreciated.
