# Installation

------------
*Please do not ask for Tech Support* (e.g. *"How do I use this mod"*). The mod is incomplete, buggy and still a work in progress; it is not yet in a state I consider acceptable for normal end users. Thank you.

## Instructions

- Download `Riders.Tweakbox.zip`.
- Navigate to the `Mods` folder inside your Reloaded folder.
- Create a folder called `riders.utils.tweakbox`.
- Extract the contents of the zip to the folder you just created.
